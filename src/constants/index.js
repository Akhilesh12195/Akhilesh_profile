export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a dedicated data science professional currently pursuing my Master's in Information Science Technology with a focus on Data Science at Claremont Graduate University. This builds upon my strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering from my Bachelor's degree at Bangalore Institute of Technology. As a Data Science Intern at MemorialCare, I'm gaining hands-on experience in healthcare analytics, where I analyze doctor-patient data, create insightful visualizations using Tableau, and develop comprehensive analytics packages.

My technical toolkit is diverse, encompassing programming languages like Python and PyTorch, data manipulation with Pandas and Numpy, and visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau. I'm proficient in machine learning techniques, including linear regression and Random Forest models, which I've applied in various projects. My experience extends to database management with MySQL, web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and ERP systems.

I've had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research projects in life sciences, including work on antibody binding affinity and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. I've developed a Docking pipeline on High-Performance Computing systems and used advanced statistical models to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. These experiences have honed my ability to translate data into actionable insights.

In my academic role, I work closely with the Dean of Information Systems and Technology, advising on scholarship decisions and managing communications with prospective students. I'm adept at using tools like Slate and Canvas for student management and leverage my communication skills to effectively convey program information and resources.`
